------------TO ADD AND REVERT MIGRATIONS
Add-Migration EFCoreCodeFirstSample.Models.AddEmployeeGender

Sometimes we add a migration and then realize we need to make additional changes to our model before applying it. To remove the last migration, we can use the command:

Remove-Migration

If we already applied a migration (or several migrations) to the database but need to revert it, we can use the same command to apply migrations, but specify the name of the migration we want to roll back to.

Let’s say we already applied the migration to add the Gender column to the database by using the below command.

update-database
